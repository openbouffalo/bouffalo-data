# OpenBouffalo Data

This repository (inspired by [stm32-data](https://github.com/embassy-rs/stm32-data)) contains machine peripheral registers, memory maps, structures, enums and much more for Bouffalo chips.

# Data schema & Folder structure

Schemas of YAML files are not strictly defined yet, and they are subject to change. That means any improvements/ideas in terms of readibility and quality of YAML files are greatly appreciated.

After at least one chip is in good shape, the schema can get stable and will be properly documented. Although, during the process, tools for schema checking might pop up, to assure consistency of the data between the changes of schema.

Currently, the data schema and folder structure is same as in [bouffalo-vendor-data](https://github.com/openbouffalo/bouffalo-vendor-data), but this is only to keep compatibility with SVD generator tool, and will change in future.

This is all for now, but this will be extended over the time.
